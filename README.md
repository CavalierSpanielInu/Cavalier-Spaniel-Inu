# ðŸ‘‘ King Charles Spaniel

A variety of the spaniel dogs, the cavalier king charles spaniel was part of the European court in the 15th century. Immortalized in the art of renowned portraitists such as Van Dyck, Titian, Stubbs, Landseer, and Gainsborough, the cavalier was popularized by Queen Mary I of Scotland and Kings Charles I and II of England - hence the name "king charles spaniel. King Charles II, in fact, was so enamored with the breed that he issued a decree allowing spaniels to be present in any public place, including parliament.

Although it was a great favorite of British aristocrats until the 19th century, its popularity declined over time, and the breed's standards ceased to be followed for a period. In the late 19th century, for example, the breed began to be crossed with Asian toy dogs, such as Japanese pugs and spaniels, to reduce the size of their muzzles.

Interest in cavalier dogs was only resumed in the 1920s, when Roswell Eldridge, an American tycoon, intrigued by the breed depicted in paintings and portraits from the 15th century, offered a cash prize to anyone who could reproduce it according to the pictorial images of the time.
