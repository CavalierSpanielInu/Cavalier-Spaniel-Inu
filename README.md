# ðŸ‘‘ King Charles Spaniel

Elizabeth II was known to be a dog aficionado, especially of the corgi breed. The animals were constant companions since the monarch's childhood. "She loved animals and she loved dogs. She always loved them, they were her first love and they will be her last."

The queen's bond with the dog was so strong that after her marriage to Phillip, Elizabeth II took Susan hidden in the royal carriage as they headed inland. She would also have joined the new couple during their honeymoon in Scotland.

'Sue', as she was called, lived until 1959. In addition to winning Elizabeth II's heart, she also spawned a long line of heirs, reaching her 14th generation, with around 30 descendants. The dog also led curious situations and even bit the heel of a Buckingham Palace employee.
